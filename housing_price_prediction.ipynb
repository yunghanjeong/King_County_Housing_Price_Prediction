    "# King County Housing Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project will utilize multiple regression analysis to predict housing prices in King County, WA. The training data will be explored for feature building and the final model will be built and trained by SciKit python library. The data and project scope was provide by Flatiron School for Data Science Immersive program phase 2 final project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "A Seattle real estate company seeks to increase porfolio in King County, WA and wants to accurately predict the sales price of a property. Having an accurate sales prediction will aid in strategizing the investment options to maximize their profit. A multiple linaer regression model will be built base on provided property data for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the exploratory phase following questions will also be focused on:\n",
    "1. What location in the county has the highest property value?\n",
    "2. What aspects of the property brings value?\n",
    "3. Do renovations have effect on property value?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the data was checked for integrity and stastistical tests such as ANOVA and Welch's T-test were performed to find significance within the data. It was found that the zipcode of the property, renotavtion status, presence of basement, and condition of the properties were found to be a significant factor of the property value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, many features were engineered to enhance the linear regression modeling. Some features were re-created as bernoulli distribution to be used as categorical data, for example presence of master bathroom. Ordinal values such as bedroom and bathrooms were also squared to accentuate the effect of multiple bathrooms and bedrooms on property prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, four linear regression models were created with statsmodel OLS method set as the baseline. This model was heavily based on engineered features. Then, three models were created from Scikit-Learn libraries: basic linear regression, linear regression with recursive feature eliminiation, and linear regression with recursive feature elimination and cross validation. Upon the coefficient analysis it was determined that the linear regression with recursive feature eliminiation model was most stable model and it was chosen for the final implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "Implementation of feature engineering and the final model for the test data set can be found in `king_county_prediction.ipynb`"

    "<br>\n",
    "Analyzing the average property values per zipcode results in Medina, Belleve, Mercer Island, Madison Park, and Capitol Hill area to be neighborhood with the highest average property values. Most properties in these neighborhood doubles the average property value of King County with average property value of Medina **quadrupling** that of King County. It seems that the proximity to the Lake Washington and large parks are driving the value of these properties higher. "
